## 📌 Course Overview

**Machine Learning** covers the theory and practice of computer programs that *learn from data and improve with
experience*. Topics span supervised and unsupervised techniques, evaluation methods, deep learning fundamentals, and
exposure to advanced areas such as generative AI and reinforcement learning.

Students will explore how to design, implement, evaluate, and document machine learning models using real data.

## 🎯 Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students should be able to:

1. **Understand core ML concepts** and relate them to practical use cases.
2. **Apply standard ML techniques** including supervised (classification, regression) and unsupervised (clustering,
   dimensionality reduction).
3. **Identify and build models** using appropriate approaches including *deep learning*, *generative models*, and
   *reinforcement learning*.
4. **Evaluate model performance** using statistical and empirical measures.
5. **Use modern ML tools and libraries** (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch).
6. **Communicate results** effectively with *visualizations*, *interpretation narratives*, and *documentation*.
